# Iterative Closest Point with Point-Feature-Histogram
#### ROB 422 Final
As point feature representations go, surface normals and curvature estimates are somewhat basic in their representations of the geometry around a specific point. Though extremely fast and easy to compute, they cannot capture too much detail, as they approximate the geometry of a pointâ€™s k-neighborhood with only a few values. As a direct consequence, most scenes will contain many points with the same or very similar feature values, thus reducing their informative characteristics.
